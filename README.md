Code and data files of the project Alviar, C., Dale, R., Galati, A. Complex Communication Dynamics: Exploring the Structure of an Academic Talk.

The "Data files" folder contains the aggregated datasets, as well as some of the raw data that were analyzed in this study. We uploaded the standardized and non-standardized versions of the complete datasets, and we also uploaded the matrices that were used to conduct PCA analysis. In this folder, you can also find raw movement data for 10 of the speakers as a trial dataset. We couldn't upload the sound files due to file size. However if you want to have access to all the raw data, including the sound files, please send a message to malviarguzman@ucmerced.com

The "Code files" folder contains the two R scripts: "Data Processing and Datasets" that contains the code we used for data prepration; and "Data Analyses" that contains the scripts we used to perform data analyses. This folder also includes two Praat Scripts. Please note that we used DeJong and Wempe's Praat script to calculate speech rate. Their script can be found here: https://github.com/FieldDB/Praat-Scripts/blob/master/praat-script-syllable-nuclei-v2file.praat

The "Individual Figures" folder contains the figures showcasing the individual speaker trends for each of the dependent variables.
